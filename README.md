A position:sticky example
============================

This is an example of how you might use the new css position:sticky property to fix a scrollyteller-like element to the screen while scrolling. This removes the slight jitter you get in the split second between scrolling and fixing the element.

For an example on the old way try the [Australia as 100 people](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-06-27/census-australia-as-100-people/8634318) ABC article.
